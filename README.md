### Grafana Dashboard

### Problem(s):

1) Because I was unable to create a VM on the CDO subscription , I had no resources to monitor in the dashboard . I believe if there was a VM available , I would be able to select that as a resource in the graphana dashboard and then select metrics to follow such as CPU usage , memoory etc.
